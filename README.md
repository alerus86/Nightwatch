# Nightwatch
This is my first work on the Nightwatch framework using JavaScript.
The only thing that is requiered per my understanding so you can execute the two scripts on it, it will be under the location of the project, as an example,
X:\Users\XXXX\IdeaProjects\ChallengeNightwatch, thru the cmd you need to run the following command npx nightwatch -e chrome
Chrome is the browser that is been use in this case for execution.
IntelliJ is the IDE use to develop the two cases for it.
